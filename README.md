# Restaurant Review: Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree project
---

In **Restaurant Reviews** project, I  converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users.
